# Kilesa's Website.

To change the amount of images rotated through, make sure all the images follow the format `img#.png`, starting at `img1.png`, and then adjust the imgAmount value in index.html.

To add images, just put them in the img folder and do above.

To change the phrase, edit index.html and change the text under BODY > HEADERTEXT > SAYING.

Other parts of the page you can easily edit are marked by `<!-- -->` comments explaining them.

To change the favicon, tab icon, edit `img/favicon.png`.

To change the effects applied to the website image, change the values in `threex.badtvpasses.js`, under `kilSettings()` function.
